Spread Sheet
============
Making a Spread Sheet with Golang to learn it, and take some ideas to my next project (A new programming language and its compiler), every operation
will be documented here, and having fun :D.

[===== TABLE =====]
The table is a file which saves something like:
    16  | "some text" | 4.3 | True
    -16 | "text some" | 3.4 | False
The serparator is '|' character, it means that in that table there are only two row and 4 columns for row.

[===== TYPES =====]
At this moment there are only four types:
    ~ Integer.
    ~ Float.
    ~ Boolean.
    ~ String.
