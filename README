Spread Sheet
============
Making a Spread Sheet with Golang to learn it, and take some ideas to my next project (A new programming language and its compiler).

[===== TABLE =====]
The table is a file which saves something like:
    16  | "some text" | 4.3 | True
    -16 | "text some" | 3.4 | False
The serparator is '|' character, it means that in that table there are only two row and 4 columns for row.

[==== ERRORS ====]
    ~ LOOP!: There was a loop in the copy operation.
    ~ OPERA: Wrong operator in arithmetic formula.
    ~ REFER: Wrong referece given as argument.
    ~ INAOP: Incomplete arithmetic operation.
    ~ DIV_0: Division by zero.
    ~ RANGE: Wrong range.

[===== TYPES =====]
At this moment there are only four types:
    ~ Integer.
    ~ Float.
    ~ Boolean.
    ~ String.

[==== COPY ====]
To copy or get the content of another cell gotta writte {XY} where:
    ~ X: Column [A-Z]
    ~ Y: Row [0-499]

[==== FSTR ====]
Formated strings are able to copy the value of another cell and added to the current string.
    ~ Input Table:
    "Hola" | 'Hi in spanish is {A0}'
    ~ Output Table:
    "Hola" | 'Hi in spanish is Hola'

[==== ARITHMETIC ====]
To make arithmetic operations (addition, substraction, multiplication and division) gotta write a formula between "[" and "]" characters.
Every element in the formula must be separated by one ";" character, just to make it easier.
    ~ Input Table:
    [4; *; 2;]
    [{A0}; +; 3; *; 4;]
    ~ Output Table:
    8.0
    20.0

[==== MAX and MIN ====]
Given a range searches for the minium or maxium value in the range, can be:
    ~ MAX/MIN( {XY} {XZ} ) -> Searches in the column from Y to Z.
    ~ MAX/MIN( {XA} {ZA} ) -> Searches in the row from X to Z.
    ~ MAX/MIN( {XA} {YB} ) -> Searches in a square from (XA) to (YB).
